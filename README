This is a simple plugin for adding static content (like ads or other
stuff) from a page (or various pages) to each page or your blog.


Just active it via the bootylicious.conf:

    ...
    "plugins" :
    [
        ...
        "top_pages", { "pages" : [ "lastfm" ] }
    ],
    ...


This example will include the page named "lastfm" right after the opening <body> tag.
